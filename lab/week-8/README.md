This is a basic version of a content archive that:

1. Manages content via an `array` of `object`s in JavaScript
2. Dynamically generates content (no html placeholders)
3. Filters based on a property in a `select` element
4. Randomizes via a `button`
5. includes basic styling

Do not just COPY this code for your project. Instead, use it as a reference for your own Archive Project #02. Try to make it more <b>interesting</b> than our in-class examples!! Think about what other filters, sorting, buttons, etc. you can use to make it more interesting. Remember, HTML supports videos and audio in addition to images.
